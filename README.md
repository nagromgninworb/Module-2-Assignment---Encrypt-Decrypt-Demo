# Module 2: Encrypt/Decrypt Demo

This program shows simple examples of both symmetric and asymmetric encryption.

## Symmetric Encryption
I used a basic Caesar shift. It uses one key to encrypt and decrypt the message.
This shows how symmetric encryption works because both sides share the same key.

## Asymmetric Encryption
I used a small RSA example. The public key encrypts the message and the private key decrypts it.
This shows how asymmetric encryption uses two different keys.

## What the program prints
- Keys used
- The original message
- Encrypted output
- Decrypted output
